# Harsh Taskmaster

Harsh is a minimalist habit tracking command line tool for tracking and examining your habits. 

It is inspired by (read: a ~~rip off~~ port of) blinary's habitctl and is designed to have simple, contained (eg. one year) habit tracking files that are human readable and comprehensible and easily edited in a text editor. It is much simpler, more understandable, and more portable than either commercial application and I found it much easier to manage than emacs native org-mode habit tracking. It incorporates a few features I wrote in habitctl that were not incorporated into habitctl such as skips and warns and a few other goodies.

It is quick and gets out of your way. I personally have it residing in a tmux tab that I refer to and track against most days as a tick off list.








## Installation

TODO: Write installation instructions here

## Usage

**habitctl** is a minimalist command line tool you can use to track and examine your habits. It was born when I grew frustrated with tracking my habits in plain text files using hand-drawn ASCII tables. habitctl tries to get the job done and then get out of your way.

## Installation

habitctl is written in the Rust programming language, so you'll need a working, up-to-date [Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org). You'll probably want to run these commands:

    $ curl -f https://sh.rustup.rs > rust.sh
    $ sh rust.sh
    $ source ~/.cargo/env

Then, compiling habitctl is as easy as this:

    $ git clone https://github.com/blinry/habitctl
    $ cd habitctl
    $ cargo build --release

This will create the binary `target/release/habitctl`, which you can add to your `$PATH`. Additionally, I like to set up an alias called `h`.

## Usage

When you run `habitctl` for the first time, it will set up the required files:

    $ h
    Welcome to habitctl!
    
    Created /home/seb/.habitctl/habits. This file will list your currently tracked habits.
    Created /home/seb/.habitctl/log. This file will contain your habit log.
    
    You don't have any habits set up!
    Run `habitctl edith` to modify the habit list using your default $EDITOR.
    Then, run `habitctl`! Happy tracking!

Run `h edith` and change the content of the habits file, for example like this:

    # The numbers specifies how often you want to do a habit:
    # 1 means daily, 7 means weekly, 0 means you're just tracking the habit. Some examples:

    1 Meditated
    7 Cleaned the apartment
    0 Had a headache
    1 Used habitctl

Here are some more ideas of what to track:

- got up at a certain time
- used a spaced repetition software like Anki
- took a multivitamin
- cleared my email inbox
- answered to all texts
- visited and read all Slack workspaces
- practiced a language
- self reflection/used a diary
- autogenic training
- published something on my blog/homepage
- worked on a project
- did the dishes
- tidied the apartment
- closed all browser tabs
- tracked caloric intake
- happy
- flow
- relaxed
- coffee intake
- left my comfort zone
- thanked someone

Then, simply run `h` regularly, specify whether or not you did the habit (or needed to skip the habit for some reason - eg. could not clean apartment because you were away for week), and get pretty graphs!

                                             ... some habits omitted ...

    Yesterday's score: 73.3%

The score specifies how many of the due habits you did that day and removes any you may have skipped from the calculation. The sparkline at the top give a graphical representation of the score. The thick lines in the graph say that you did the habit, the thin lines say that that it was okay that you didn't to it. A thick dot implies you had to skip or were unable to exercise a habit for whatever good reason, and a thin dot indicates the period for which a skip would normally be in effect (in the example above, we are suggesting you could not clean your apartment because you were on a business trip when you'd normally clean it and can thus excuse yourself.).

Also, on the day, if a habit chain is in danger of breaking because it's the last day you can do it before the consistency graph would have a gap in it, habitctl will give you a warning by turning the " " symbol you'd see on the day into an "!".

Enter `h help` if you're lost:

    $ h help
    USAGE:
        habitctl [SUBCOMMAND]
    
    FLAGS:
        -h, --help       Prints help information
        -V, --version    Prints version information
    
    SUBCOMMANDS:
        ask      Ask for status of all habits for a day
        edit     Edit habit log file

        log      Print habit log
